		Some organizations love to publish lots of content. Perhaps
		because they believe that having an org chart, a mission state- ment,
		a vision declaration, and a corporate inspirational video
		on the About Us page will retroactively validate the hours and
		days of time spent producing that content. Perhaps because
		they believe Google will only bless their work if they churn
		out dozens of blog posts per week. In most cases, I think en- tropy
		deserves the blame: the web offers the space to publish
		everything, and it’s much easier to treat it like a hall closet
		with infinite stuffing-space than to impose constraints.
		<p>So what does it matter if we have too much content? For<br>
		one thing, more content makes everything more difficult to
		find. For another, spreading finite resources ever more thinly
		results in a decline in quality. It also often indicates a deeper
		problem—publishing <i>everything</i> often means “publishing ev- erything
		we can,” rather than “publishing everything we’ve
		learned that our users really need.”</p>
		<p>There are many ways to discover which content is in fact
		needless; traffic analysis, user research, and editorial judgment
		should all play a role. You may also wish to begin with a hit
		list of common stowaways:</p>
		<ul class = "te">
			<li>
			<b>Mission statements, vision statements, and core values</b>.If
			the people within your organization are genuinely commit-<br>ted
			to abstract principles, it will show in what they do. The
			exception is the small number of organizations for whom
			the mission is the product, as is the case with many chari-<br>ties.
			Even then, this kind of content should be supplement-<br>ed
			with plentiful evidence of follow-through.</li>

			<li><b>Press releases</b>. These may work for their very narrow in-<br>tended
			audience, but putting them undigested onto a web-<br>site
			is a perfect example of the how-we’ve-always-done-it
			<br>mistake.</li>

			<li><b>Long, unreadable legal pages</b>. Some legal awkwardness is
			acceptable, but if you want to demonstrate that you respect
